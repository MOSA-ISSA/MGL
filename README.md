**MGL** is a React Native CLI project inspired by **My Anime List (MAL)**. It provides users with a platform to organize, filter, search, and explore their favorite shows, movies, and more. This was my first college project, where I integrated both frontend and backend functionalities to deliver a feature-rich application.
